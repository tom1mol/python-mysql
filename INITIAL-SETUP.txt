When using libraries, it's a good idea to keep a record of which ones you've used and which versions:
              
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

That creates a requirements.txt file, which is just a list of all the packages and libraries that are used.
It's handy when you push to Git that you have a list of exactly what you used.
